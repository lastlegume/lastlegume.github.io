A [spreadsheet]() that automates many parts of tournament scoring in Science Olympiad.

Note: The [spreadsheet made by Chalker](https://sourceforge.net/projects/soscoring/) is similar, is updated to each year's events, and has some unique features, so it is also a good resource to consider for scoring. However, it lacks the template-based automatic award slideshow generation and histogram generation of the Google Sheets spreadsheet shown here. 


{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
