A [spreadsheet](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DF87DjKOUex4asVBe3NNlvypM_p7HEZ0?usp=drive_link) that automates many parts of tournament scoring in Science Olympiad. To see how to use it, check [this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CCglZCkHo_RaGaMjVx0MpuHMKf2cjOdX48RMITGZ7OU/edit?usp=sharing).

Note: The [spreadsheet made by Chalker](https://sourceforge.net/projects/soscoring/) is similar, is updated to each year's events, and has some unique features, so it is also a good resource to consider for scoring. However, it lacks the template-based automatic award slideshow generation and histogram generation of the Google Sheets spreadsheet shown here. Use your own discretion to decide which spreadsheet better fits your own needs.
