I've been writing Science Olympiad tests in LaTeX for a while, so recently, I decided to work on a clean [template](https://www.overleaf.com/read/hxqbzhngffmg#97c754) for tests with some basic instructions in it. All instructions are in the comments in the template, and it includes examples of various question types, explanations of code, and commands to simplify the process. 

The [ScilympiadToLaTeX extension](/extensions#stl) also includes an option to export scilympiad into this template. Some code will still need to be manually changed, but the text from the export will be fairly close to being a finished test.

I have also written a [guide](/blog/latex_tutorial) to the basics of writing a test with LaTeX to go along with the template.
