### Website Time Tracker  

A Firefox exclusive extension that tracks which sites you spend your time on and which hours of the day you use your browser. The extension tracks the usage data for the day, week, month, and total and stores it locally. Data is displayed in clear, easy to understand charts using [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/ "Chart.js"), and the extension icon shows the time spent on the current site during the current day.

### Countdown Timer

An extension that counts down until a certain date and time. You can add as many timers as you want (currently Firefox exclusive), and the extension icon displays a pie chart showing the percentage of time elapsed between the start of the timer and the target time.

### ExCiter

An extension that removes the citations from [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) and the [USDA FEIS database](https://www.feis-crs.org/feis/) to clean up reading. Also has additional options for cleaning that may not work on many sites such as removing APA citations.

### Scilympiad To LaTeX

An extension that (mostly) converts a [scilympiad](https://scilympiad.com/) test into LaTeX formatted text. Contains options to customize environments for different questions types and generate a simple preamble and gradetable.  
This extension isn't perfect and will need modifications such as pagebreaks to be added to the files it generates. It also cannot convert math and will delete all math equations from the test. However, it works with most questions and should be used only as a tool to speed up conversion.
