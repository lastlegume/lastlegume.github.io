Just some person who likes [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) and [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/). I write extensions for both [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/17603989/) and [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/lastlegume), [tools](/scioly-tools) for [Science Olympiad (Scioly)](https://www.soinc.org/) Tournaments, and am an infrequent game jam participant on itch.io.
