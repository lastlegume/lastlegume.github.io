# All of the tools I've made for Science Olympiad

### [Tournament Scoring Spreadsheet](/blog/scoring_spreadsheet)

A spreadsheet that manages tournament scoring with the automatic ranking, any number of events, tie identification, fully customizable awards slideshow generation, exporting to scoresheets or duosmium, and automatic histogram generation built into the spreadsheet. Read [the user manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CCglZCkHo_RaGaMjVx0MpuHMKf2cjOdX48RMITGZ7OU/edit?usp=sharing) to see how to use it. 

### [Answer Sheet Generator](/answer-sheet)

A tool to convert a class set test into a clean, LaTeX answer sheet with a large degree of customization. All answers to free response questions should be written on the line after the question and commented out.

### [Scilympiad To LaTeX Browser Extension](/extensions#stl)

An extension to convert Science Olympiad tests on Scilympiad into beautiful LaTeX tests with some customization. It does not support conversion of math and also might leave artifacts that must be cleaned up manually such as poorly sized images. 

### [LaTeX Tutorial and Template](/blog/latex_tutorial)

A [template](/blog/tex_template) and [accompanying tutorial](/blog/latex_tutorial) that explain the basics of writing SciOly tests in LaTeX (mostly basics of the exam class) and some specific choices I make in my tests. 

### [Entomology ID Site](/taxon-id)

Chooses random images of the desired species/taxa and asks for the answer. The site includes a variety of features, including autocomplete for taxa names and full customization within the list of available taxa. Currently uses the 2025 Science Olympiad Entomology List but can in theory use any taxa that is found on iNaturalist.

### [ExCiter](/extensions#exciter)

An extension that removes citations from websites (specifically tested on wikipedia, USDA FEIS, and NCBI) for copy pasting or just cleaner reading. Also includes the option to choose sites to remove citations from, but since formats vary widely, there is no guarantee for success on untested sites.
