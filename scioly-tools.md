# All of the tools I've made for Science Olympiad

### [Tournament Scoring Spreadsheet](/blog/scoring_spreadsheet)

A spreadsheet that manages tournament scoring with the automatic ranking, any number of events, tie identification, fully customizable awards slideshow generation, exporting to scoresheets or duosmium, and automatic histogram generation built into the spreadsheet. Read [the user manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CCglZCkHo_RaGaMjVx0MpuHMKf2cjOdX48RMITGZ7OU/edit?usp=sharing) to see how to use it. 

### [Scilympiad To LaTeX Browser Extension](/extensions#stl)

An extension to convert Science Olympiad tests on Scilympiad into beautiful LaTeX tests with some customizability. It does not support conversion of math and also might leave artifacts that must be cleaned up manually such as poorly sized images. 

### [LaTeX Tutorial and Template](/blog/latex_tutorial)

A [template](/blog/tex_template) and [accompanying tutorial](/blog/latex_tutorial) that explain the basics of writing SciOly tests in LaTeX (mostly basics of the exam class) and some specific choices I make in my tests. 

### [ExCiter](/extensions#exciter)

An extension that removes citations from websites (specifically tested on wikipedia, USDA FEIS, and NCBI) for copy pasting or just cleaner reading. Also includes the option to choose sites to remove citations from, but since formats vary widely, there is no guarantee for success on untested sites.
